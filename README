# emailtools
Node JS set of tools to ease working with Email protocols. 

This module is just combination of several great nodejs modules for working with emails including

* [IMAP](https://github.com/mscdex/node-imap)
* [MailParser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailparser)

with an abstraction layer on top of them to make working with emails easier.

The module is under active development at the moment and is mainly used for my internal projects.
